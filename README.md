# UCSD-Basketball-Stuff
A Space where I keep track of the UCSD basketball team's stats while creating different algorithms to assess player performance.

Please keep track of stats in txt files in this order:
    [name, points, offensive RB, defensive RB, Assists, Steals, Blocks, Turnover,
    free throws made off of passes, field goals, field goals attempted,
    free throws, free throws attempted, personal fouls]
